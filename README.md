## Story
    Onboard the ship Defiance, a crew of diverse individuals embarked on a mission to reach the planet known as Xeon-9VN6. Among them were Ethan Mitchells, the ship's head mechanic, and Dr. Olivia Reynolds, a very intelligent biologist. However, their journey faced multiple challenges, starting with the ship enduring asteroid showers that caused irreparable damage, rendering the mission impossible.

    During an first asteroid shower, the ship's electrical systems were severely affected. Tragically, the two crew members, Dr. Olivia Reynolds and Ethan Mitchells', stasis pods experienced an electrical fault. They were abruptly awakened fifty-three years and four months earlier than originally planned. Desperate to re-enter stasis, Mitchells attempted to fix the pods but to no avail. Their only hope was to remove the logic boards from another pair of stasis pods. However, ship logs revealed that no other logic boards had been tampered with.

    Thirteen years passed, during which Ethan and Olivia made modifications to the ship's systems to ensure their survival. However, yet another devastating asteroid shower struck the ship, causing further issues with the ship. Irreparable damage was caused to the life support and fueling systems... Most of the crew's stasis pods failed, resulting in the loss of their occupants. Dr Reynolds faced the difficult decision of rerouting fuel to a backup generator, build by Mitchells, connected to the remaining pods to ensure no other lives would be lost due to electrical failures, sacrificing the possibility of reaching Xeon-9VN6. Instead, the navigation system detected another planet only a few light years away, and the mostly undamaged autopilot redirected the ship towards it.

    The new journey would take approximately twenty six years to complete. Over this time, the surviving two crew-mates faced numerous challenges. Mitchells tragically lost his life while attempting to fix a gas leak in the ship's repulser lift maintenance room. Dr Reynolds, the talented biologist, succumbed to an oxygen shortage in the hydroponics room. The most catastrophic event occurred when a small meteor penetrated the ship's hull in the vehicle storage bay. This meteor carried a deadly pathogen capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. Breaching the ship's emergency airlock doors, the pathogen consumed the corpses onboard the ship and transformed them into mindless, flesh-hungry creatures that posed a grave threat to the ship's integrity. These creatures reanimated the corpses, and their minds. Only, they weren't in control. Instead they were trapped in their minds, unable to escape.

    Despite the immense challenges they faced, Mitchells and Dr. Reynolds' resourcefulness and expertise were critical for the survival of the remaining crew members. Their unwavering determination to adapt and overcome these obstacles became a beacon of hope in the face of unimaginable adversity. Together, they sought to find a way to navigate the treacherous journey and save the remaining lives aboard the Defiance.

    After the grueling passage of twenty-five years, your stasis pod finally awakens you from the slumber of deep space. As the sole surviving officer aboard the ship, your primary responsibility is to pilot the vessel and eradicate the insidious parasitic infestation that plagues its corridors. Your destination is now within reach, and as you prepare to land on the new planet, a weighty task lies ahead: awakening the remaining crew from their long hibernation. Together, you must forge a new existence on this unfamiliar world, embarking on a journey of resilience and adaptation as you strive to build a life amidst the uncharted horizons of your new home.
