Crash Site: You find yourself amidst twisted metal and smoldering wreckage.
The air is heavy with the acrid stench of burnt circuits.
Flames flicker sporadically, casting eerie shadows on the alien terrain.
An eerie silence fills the air, broken only by the occasional crackling of electrical sparks.
Among the wreckage, you spot a damaged data terminal, its screen barely flickering with life.
